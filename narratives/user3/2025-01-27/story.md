# Sophie's Story: The Notepad

On Monday, Sophie decided to surprise her wife, [[Alice(M-L)]], with a visit during her lunch break at the [[Cafe(M-L)]]. She brought along her sketchbook, hoping to capture the cafe's lively atmosphere and maybe even sneak in a drawing or two of Alice while she worked. As she was sketching, she looked out of the window and saw [[George(M-L)]] sitting on a bench. A pang of sympathy struck her; she often saw him in the [[Town Square(M-L)]] and wished there was something she could do to help him get back on his feet. She asked Alice to make a sandwich and coffee to take out to him.

Leaving the cafe, she went and sat with [[George(M-L)]] for a while in the [[Town Square(M-L)]], offering him the food and drink.

As she returned to the cafe she noticed a notepad left behind on a table. She saw [[Daniel(M-L)]] but he was engrossed in his newspaper. [[John(M-M)]] must have forgotten it when he left earlier. She picked it up, thinking she'd give it to Alice to put in the lost and found.
