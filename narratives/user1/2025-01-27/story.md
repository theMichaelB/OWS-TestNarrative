# John's Story: The Lost Notepad

John, a journalist known for his investigative reporting, had a very important interview scheduled for Monday morning. He arrived early at the [[Cafe(M-M)]] to prepare.

[[Jane(M-M)]] arrived, and the interview began. They discussed the job role, Jane's experience, and some of the recent happenings in Oakhaven. John made notes in his trusty notepad, jotting down key details and observations. He saw [[Daniel(M-M)]] sat in the corner reading his newspaper, he made a mental note to try and speak to him later.

Distracted by the engaging conversation, John left the [[Cafe(M-M)]] without his notepad.

It wasn't until the [[Afternoon(M-A)]] that John realized his notepad was missing. Panic set in. He retraced his steps, but the notepad was nowhere to be found.
