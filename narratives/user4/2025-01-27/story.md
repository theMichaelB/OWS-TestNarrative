# Alice's Story: Another Day at the Cafe

Monday at the [[Cafe(M-E)]] was busy as usual.  The morning rush was a blur of familiar faces and coffee orders.

The highlight of my day was when my wife, [[Sophie(M-L)]], surprised me with a visit during her lunch break. She sat at a table, sketching in her book, and I loved watching her concentrate. She saw [[George(M-L)]] outside and asked me to make a sandwich and coffee for him, which she took out to the [[Town Square(M-L)]].

Later, after [[Sophie(M-L)]] had left, a notepad was handed in by one of the customers, which I put in the lost and found. It had been left on one of the tables, hopefully, the owner would come back to claim it.
