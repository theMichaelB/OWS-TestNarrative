# Jane's Story: A New Beginning

Jane was excited and nervous about her job interview on Monday. She arrived at the [[Cafe(M-M)]] and met with [[John(M-M)]], a journalist known for his hard-hitting stories. She noticed [[Daniel(M-M)]] sitting at a table in the corner.

The interview went well, and they talked about the job, her experience, and the vibrant, sometimes secretive, town of Oakhaven.

After the interview, Jane decided to take a stroll through the [[Town Square(M-A)]]. As she walked, she heard the beautiful sounds of a violin. She saw [[Clara(M-A)]] playing, her music filling the square. Jane stopped to listen for a while, captivated by Clara's talent. Noticing she was being watched, Clara stopped and chatted for a while, telling Jane about her dreams of making it big in the music industry.
